### Step 4: Upload Release Files

## Method 2: Check GitHub Actions

### Step 1: Check if Actions Ran
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/i3mr01/MusicRP
2. Click on the **"Actions"** tab
3. Look for any workflows that ran when we pushed the tag
4. If there are failed workflows, check the logs

### Step 2: Manual Trigger (if needed)
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click on **"Build and Release"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"** button
4. Select **"Run workflow"** from the dropdown
5. This should trigger the automated release

## Method 3: Using GitHub CLI (Advanced)

If you want to use command line:

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI first
# Then authenticate
gh auth login

# Create release
gh release create v1.0.1 --title "i3mr0 MusicRP v1.0.1" --notes "Release notes here" i3mr0-MusicRP-v1.0.0-Release.zip
```

## üéØ What Should Happen

After creating the release, users will be able to:
1. **Download** the release files from the GitHub releases page
2. **See** your professional release notes
3. **Get** the complete i3mr0 MusicRP application
4. **Use** it immediately without any setup

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If the tag doesn't appear:
- Make sure you're on the correct repository
- Check that the tag was pushed: `git tag -l` should show `v2.0.2`

### If the release creation fails:
- Make sure you have write permissions to the repository
- Check that you're logged into the correct GitHub account

### If GitHub Actions didn't run:
- Check the Actions tab for any error messages
- The workflow should trigger automatically on tag push

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

You'll know it worked when:
- The release appears on the releases page
- Users can download the zip file
- The release shows up in the repository's main page
- GitHub Actions shows a successful workflow run
