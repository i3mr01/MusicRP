# 🚀 Manual Release Creation Guide

### Step 4: Publish

## 🔍 Alternative: Use GitHub CLI

If you have GitHub CLI installed:

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI first
# Then authenticate
gh auth login

# Create release with files
gh release create v2.0.5 --title "i3mr0 MusicRP v2.0.5" --notes "Release notes here" ./release-files/
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

After creating the release:
- ✅ **Users can download** your application
- ✅ **Professional presentation** with release notes
- ✅ **Complete application** with all dependencies
- ✅ **Ready to use** immediately

## 🚀 Your i3mr0 MusicRP is Ready!
